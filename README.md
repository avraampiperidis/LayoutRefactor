java swing ui interface that can refactor android layout xml files.<br>
ex. for all xml tags add or remove 10 to all dp or sp or both. <br>

the idea is to create a ui form that the user can choose an android layout xml file,<br>
set up parameters and automaticly generate xml for large and x-large layouts.<br>
At this point it has only the basic functions that can add/remove dp/sp from all tags.<br>
<br>
build with maven using netbeans
